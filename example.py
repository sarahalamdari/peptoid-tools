### Assembling a peptoid sheet
# First initialize a builder object and build a single peptoid (available res
# can be found in res_lib. We'll be looking at BTM_perp and BTM_par for 
# the perpendicular and parallel arrangements
builder = assembler.Builder()
builder.assemble('BTM_perp', 6, 'CTM', 6, 'bilayer')

# Next we intialize a packer object that packs the peptoid into a sheet.
# the x_gen() method copies the peptoid in the x-dimension n times with a
# distance of d in between oligomers. Similarly, y_gen() copies the newly
# created x-dimension n times in the y direction - again with a distance of
# d between each copy. Distances are initialized to realistic values so 
# to create a bigger sheet all you need to adjust are the number of repeats
# in x and y.
packer = assembler.Packer(builder)
packer.x_gen(n_repeats=5, d=18, ring_type='perpendicular')
packer.copy_in_dim(n_repeats=17, d=4.5)

# The last thing we do is create a writer object and send it the packer object
# which contains the fully formed sheet as well as the filename we want to
# write to. 
writer = assembler.PDBWriter()
writer.write_pack(packer, 'thic_perp_18.pdb')



### Making PDBs
#builder = assembler.Builder()
#writer = assembler.PDBWriter()

#n=2
#builder.assemble('1BTM_d', n, 'CTM', 0, 'bilayer')
#writer.write_build(builder, '1BTM_d12.pdb')
